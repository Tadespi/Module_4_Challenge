# School District Analysis

# Introduction:
As the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district, you'll be analyzing district-wide standardized test results to help make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. This analysis will involve creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to aggregate data and showcase trends in school performance.

# Instructions:
This assignment is divided into several parts, each focusing on different aspects of school district analysis.

# District Summary:
- Calculate key metrics for the entire district, such as total number of schools, total students, total budget, average math and reading scores, and percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
- Present the results in a DataFrame named "district_summary".

# School Summary:
- Calculate key metrics for each school, including school type, total students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, and percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall.
- Present the results in a DataFrame named "school_summary".

# Highest-Performing Schools:
- Sort schools by percentage of overall passing students in descending order and display the top 5 performing schools in a DataFrame named "top_schools".

# Lowest-Performing Schools:
- Sort schools by percentage of overall passing students in ascending order and display the bottom 5 performing schools in a DataFrame named "bottom_schools".

# Math and Reading Scores by Grade:
- Calculate average math and reading scores for each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
- Present the results in separate DataFrames for math and reading scores by grade.

# Scores by School Spending:
- Categorize schools based on per student spending ranges and calculate average math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, for each spending range.
- Present the results in a DataFrame named "spending_summary".

# Scores by School Size:
- Categorize schools based on size (small, medium, large) and calculate average math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, for each size category.
- Present the results in a DataFrame named "size_summary".

# Scores by School Type:
- Calculate average math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, for each school type (charter, district).
- Present the results in a DataFrame named "type_summary".

# Conclusion:
Provide a written description of at least two observable trends based on the analysis of the school district data.
